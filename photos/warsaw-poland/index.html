<meta name="twitter:description" content="The Banaue Rice Terraces, located in the town of Banaue in Ifugao province, is a testament to the ingenuity and craftsmanship of the locals. Roughly 350 kilometers from Manila City, a trip to this UNESCO World Heritage Site in the North Luzon region takes around 8 to 10 hours by land, but the journey is well worth it.Hand-carved into the mountainsides over 2,000 years ago, the terraces are one of the most iconic landmarks in the Philippines, showcasing generations of craftsmanship and devotion.
Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the terraces offer spectacular views, especially during the rice-growing seasons from April to May and October to November. During these times, the terraces transform into layers of vibrant emerald green, creating a stunning landscape that captivates visitors from all over the world.While exploring the region of North Luzon, you can expand your itinerary to include other must-visit destinations such as the serene town of Sagada, the cool pine-tree-filled city of Baguio, or the remote village of Buscalan, where you can meet the legendary tattoo artist Apo Whang-Od who is over 100 years old."/>

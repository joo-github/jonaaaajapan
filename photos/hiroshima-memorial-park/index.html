<meta name="twitter:description" content="The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, is a poignant symbol of peace and a powerful reminder of the devastating impact of nuclear warfare.

<p>The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, is a poignant symbol of peace and a powerful reminder of the devastating impact of nuclear warfare. Established in 1954, the park was built in the heart of the area devastated by the atomic bomb dropped on August 6, 1945, during World War II. It spans over 120,000 square meters and is surrounded by the Motoyasu River, offering a serene contrast to its tragic history.</p>
<p>Central to the park is the iconic A-Bomb Dome, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that stands as a preserved ruin of the former Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, near the bomb&rsquo;s hypocenter. Other key features include the Peace Memorial Museum, which educates visitors about the horrors of the bombing through artifacts, photographs, and personal stories, and the Cenotaph, which holds the names of all known victims, inscribed with the words, “Let all the souls here rest in peace, for we shall not repeat the evil.”</p>
<p>The park also houses the Children’s Peace Monument, adorned with thousands of colorful paper cranes, inspired by Sadako Sasaki, a young victim of radiation sickness. Each year, the Peace Memorial Ceremony attracts thousands, promoting global harmony and advocating for nuclear disarmament. The park remains a profound testament to resilience and hope.</p>

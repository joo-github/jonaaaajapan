Hokkaido’s Furano and Biei regions are renowned for their breathtaking landscapes, particularly the stunning lavender fields that bloom vibrantly during the summer months. Located in the heart of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, these areas are famous for their rolling hills, picturesque rural scenery, and colorful flower fields that draw visitors from around the world.

Furano, in particular, is home to some of Japan's most iconic lavender fields, which are a major attraction between late June and early August. The sight of vast, purple-hued fields set against the backdrop of the majestic Tokachi Mountain Range creates an idyllic, almost otherworldly atmosphere. The largest and most famous lavender farm is the Farm Tomita, which boasts expansive fields of lavender and other colorful flowers, such as sunflowers and poppies. The fragrance of lavender fills the air, offering visitors a sensory experience in addition to the visual beauty. During the peak lavender season, the fields are in full bloom, attracting thousands of tourists, photographers, and nature enthusiasts.

Nearby, the town of Biei is equally famous for its rolling hills and vibrant flower fields. The region’s Patchwork Road and Panorama Road are especially popular for driving tours, where visitors can see vast, checkerboard-like landscapes of fields that change with the seasons. In addition to lavender, Biei is known for fields of canola flowers, lupines, and poppies, creating a patchwork of colors that stretches across the horizon.

Both Furano and Biei are also celebrated for their agricultural products, including fresh produce, dairy, and wine. These areas offer a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of city life, inviting visitors to experience the beauty of rural Japan, its natural charm, and its rich agricultural traditions. Whether admiring the flowers or enjoying local delicacies, Furano and Biei provide an unforgettable experience of Hokkaido’s scenic wonders.
